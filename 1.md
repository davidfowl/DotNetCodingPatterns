## Generics types as a factory

This pattern is used in **Microsoft.Extensions.\*** and in **Microsoft.AspNetCore.\***. The idea is that you can use a generic type as a factory instead of a function. The type argument is the 
type you want to instantiate. Consider the example below where we have an `IServiceFactory<TService>` that can resolve the `TService` from the DI container or creates an instance if it's 
not in the container.

```C#
public interface IServiceFactory<TService>
{
    TService Service { get; }
}

public class ServiceFactory<TService> : IServiceFactory<TService>
{
    public ServiceFactory(IServiceProvider service)
    {
        Service = (TService)service.GetService(typeof(TService)) ?? ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<TService>(service);
    }

    public TService Service { get; private set; }
}
```

The constructor has a access to any service *and* the generic type being requested. These open generic services are registered like this:

```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient(typeof(IServiceFactory<>), typeof(ServiceFactory<>));
}
```

## Lazy initialization of services

Sometimes it's necessary to create services later than a constructor. The usually work around for this is to inject and `IServiceProvider` into the constructor of the service that needs to lazily create the instance.

```C#
public class Service
{
    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;
    public void Something(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider;
    }
    
    public IFoo CreateFoo() => _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IFoo>();
    public IBar CreateBar() => _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IBar>();
}
```

If the types are known ahead of time, we can build a custom service provider lazy type to encapsulate the service locator pattern:

```C#
public interface ILazy<T>
{
    T Value { get; }
}

public class LazyFactory<T> : ILazy<T>
{
    private readonly Lazy<T> _lazy;

    public LazyFactory(IServiceProvider service)
    {
        _lazy = new Lazy<T>(() => service.GetRequiredService<T>());
    }

    public T Value => _lazy.Value;
}

public class Service
{
    private readonly ILazy<IFoo> _foo;
    private readonly ILazy<IBar> _bar;
    public void Something(ILazy<IFoo> foo, ILazy<IBar> bar)
    {
        _foo = foo;
        _bar = bar;
    }
    
    public IFoo CreateFoo() => _foo.Value;
    public IBar CreateBar() => _bar.Value;
}
```

Registered like this:

```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // We register this as transient so it handles both singleton and scoped services
    // as the IServiceProvider injected will have the relevant lifetime.
    services.AddTransient(typeof(ILazy<>), typeof(LazyFactory<>));
}
```

`Lazy<T>` could also be used as-is if added with a concrete type at service registration time:

```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<Lazy<IFoo>>(sp => new Lazy<IFoo>(() => sp.GetRequiredService<IFoo>());
    services.AddTransient<Lazy<IBar>>(sp => new Lazy<IBar>(() => sp.GetRequiredService<IBar>());
}
```

## Single implementation multiple interfaces

Let's say you had a type that implemented multiple interfaces and you wanted to expose it using the DI container. The built in `IServiceCollection` type doesn't natively support this but it's easy to emulate using the following pattern.

```C#
public class FooAndBar : IFoo, IBar
{
   // Imagine a useful implementation
}
```

```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<FooAndBar>();
    services.AddSingleton<IFoo>(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<FooAndBar>());
    services.AddSingleton<IBar>(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<FooAndBar>());
}
```

This will let me resolve `FooAndBar`, `IFoo` and `IBar` and it will give me the same instance.

## Creating instances of types from an IServiceProvider

Usually you need to register a type in order to instantiate instances of a type from the DI container, somebody needs to call `IServiceProvider.GetService`. This means that the service needs to be registered in the container. This may not be desirable if these types are discovered dynamically (like controllers in MVC). There's a useful utility called [ActivatorUtilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilities?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0) that can be used as a factory for types that haven't been registered, but have dependencies that are registered in the DI container.

```C#
public class MyDependency
{
    public MyDependency(ILogger logger)
    {
    }
}
```

```C#
public class MyDependencyFactory
{
    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;
    public MyDependencyFactory(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider;
    }
    public MyDependency GetInstance()
    {
        return ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<MyDependency>(_serviceProvider);
    }
}
```

You can build a more optimized version of this uses the [`CreateFactory`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilities.createfactory?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0#Microsoft_Extensions_DependencyInjection_ActivatorUtilities_CreateFactory_System_Type_System_Type___). This will pre-calculate the constructor 
based on the types passed and build a factory for it.

```C#
public class MyDependencyFactory
{
    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;
    private readonly ObjectFactory _factory;
    public MyDependencyFactory(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider;
        _factory = ActivatorUtilities.CreateFactory(typeof(MyDependency), Type.EmptyTypes);
    }
    public MyDependency GetInstance()
    {
        return _factory(_serviceProvider, null);
    }
}
```

**NOTE: Disposable instances created with this API will not be disposed by the DI container.**

## Caching singletons in generic types

If you need to cache an instance of something based on type, then you can store it on a static field of a generic type.

```C#
public class Factory
{
    public T Create<T>()
    {
        return Cache<T>.Instance;
    }
    
    private static class Cache<T>
    {
        public static T Instance = new T();
    }
}
```

You can use the JIT to cache instances on your behalf instead of a slower `ConcurrentDictionary<Type, T>`. It can also be used to cache the expensive object creation process:

```C#
public class Factory
{
    public T Create<T>()
    {
        return Cache<T>.Instance;
    }
    
    private static class Cache<T>
    {
        public static T Instance = CallExpensiveMethodToBuildANewInstance();
        
        public static T CallExpensiveMethodToBuildANewInstance()
        {
            // Imagine a really complex process to construct T
            return instance.
        }
    }
}
```

## Resolving services when using IOptions\<T\>

The options pattern is used in **Microsoft.Extensions.\*** and in **Microsoft.AspNetCore.\***. It allows anyone to register a callback to mutate a POCO used to configure a library. Sometimes you'd like access to services when configuring these options. There are multiple ways to do this:

```C#
public class LibraryOptions
{
    public int Setting { get; set; }
}

public class MyConfigureOptions : IConfigureOptions<LibraryOptions>
{
    private readonly ISomeService _service;
    public MyConfigureOptions(ISomeService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }
    
    public void Configure(LibraryOptions options)
    {
        options.Setting = _service.ComputeSetting();
    }
}
```

Followed by the registration.

```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<IConfigureOptions<LibraryOptions>, MyConfigureOptions>();
}
```

That's a bit verbose, so we added some helpers to make it easier.

```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddOptions<LibraryOptions>()
            .Configure<ISomeService>((options, service) =>
            {
                options.Setting = service.ComputeSetting();
            });
}
```
